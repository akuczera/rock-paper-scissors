//start with function computerPlay that randomly returns either Rock,
//Paper, or Scissors. This function will make the "computers play"

//create a function to play s single round of RPS, should take two
//parameters, playerSelection & computerSelection, returns a string that
//declares the winner of the game (ie. You lose! The computer wins!).
//NOTE: playerSelection should be case insensitive, doesn't matter how
//someone types it in. & "RETURN" the results of this function, not
//console.log() it, because we want to use this data later.

//START WITH THESE TWO FUNCTIONS THEN MOVE ONTO PART 5 OF THE PROJECT.
